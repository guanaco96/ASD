Excercises from "Algoritmi e Strutture Dati" course (Unipi 2016-17).

All these exercises are written in C and their purpose is to deepen my comprehension of basic algoithms and data structures, always present in higher level programming languages' libraries, implementing them once by myself.

You can find [HERE](http://carp.di.unipi.it/asd1718/#/tasks/1) original problems (in italian) and an automated evaluation platform.
